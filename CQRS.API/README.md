CQRS and MdiatR with ASP.NET Core Web Api

-Command Query Responsibility Segreration

-Clean Architecture and its layered abstraction

-MediatR library is used to separate your application's logic from the Presentation Layer

-Your presentation layer could be a .NET Wep API

-Another advantage is the separation of Reads and Writes (CQS) that comes from MediatR

-Mediator Pattern define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact (Basically provides a mechanism on how different services interact with each other, instead of these services being inter-connected to the other service they need to interact with)
